# üçî FoodLoops - Reduce Waste, Share Abundance

FoodLoops is a dynamic web application designed to combat food waste by connecting sellers of surplus food with conscientious buyers. Leveraging a dynamic pricing model, prices for items decrease as their expiration dates approach, ensuring that food gets sold rather than discarded.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the FoodLoops application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm
- MongoDB installed and running
- Google Gemini API key

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Priyanshu-Ghosh-unplugged/foodloops-google-tech
cd foodloops-google-tech
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

The project uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following:

```env
# Firebase Configuration
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your_firebase_api_key"
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id

# Google Gemini AI API Key
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

```

The server also requires environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory:

```env
# Your MongoDB connection string
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/foodloops

# A secret for signing JWTs (optional for local dev)
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

This project is a monorepo-style setup with separate dependencies for the root (frontend) and the server (backend).

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd server
npm install
cd ..
```

### 4. Run the Application

To run both the frontend and backend servers concurrently, use the dev:full script from the root directory.

```bash
npm run dev:full
```

This will:
- Start the Vite frontend development server on `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).
- Start the Express backend server on `http://localhost:3001`.


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Gemini AI**: Verify API key and check console for errors
